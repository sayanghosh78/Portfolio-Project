# 📌 **Project Description — College Internship Website (3rd Semester, Diploma in CSE)**

This project is part of my **3rd-semester summer internship** during my **Diploma in Computer Science & Engineering (CSE)**. It is a fully responsive and modern college project website developed collaboratively as a group assignment. The goal of this project was to apply our academic knowledge to a real-world style web development workflow, focusing on clean UI design, efficient code structure, and practical implementation of core web technologies.

The website is designed to serve as a **central hub for college-related information**, showcasing various sections such as the home page, about section, departments, facilities, events, contact form, and more. Throughout the project, I contributed to planning, UI/UX design, frontend development, and improving responsiveness across devices.
